# My Python projects (beginner)
Here are some of the Python coding tasks that I have completed as part of my Software Egineering Bootcamp. 

### Finance Calculators
For this task I had to write code to calculate the interest earned on an investment, as well as the repayment amount on a loan.

### A simple game
For this task I had to write code for a simple game. This was done with the help of pygame. The game allows the player to use the arrows to escape enemies and capture rewards. The source code is included, as well as a zip folder with the images, should anyone want to test the code on their own system.

### Task Manager
This task was completed in 2 parts. The second part is an update of the first and has more functionalities. This task showcases some elementary python skills like using user input to perform some functionalities.
