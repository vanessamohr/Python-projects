# My Python projects (beginner)
Here are some of the Python coding tasks that I have completed as part of my Software Egineering Bootcamp. 

### Finance Calculators
For this task I had to write code to calculate the interest earned on an investment, as well as the repayment amount on a loan.

### A simple game
For this task I had to write code for a simple game. This was done with the help of pygame. The game allows the player to use the arrows to escape enemies and capture rewards. The source code is includes, as well as a zip folder with the images, should someone want to test the code on their own system.
